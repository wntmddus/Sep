1. Binary Search Tree does not process inserts with 100000 elements in it.
it halts in the middle of operation.
However, since min binary heap has running time of O(1) for inserts it processes 100000 elements
That shows that min binary heap is far more efficient than Binary Search Tree

2. Since Binary Search Tree cannot process inserting 100000 elements, I only got the benchmarks
for min binary heap only
user     system      total        real
MinBinaryHeap insert 100000:   0.710000   0.010000   0.720000 (  0.726398)
MinBinaryHeap find 50000  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.004945)
MinBinaryHeap delete 50000   0.030000   0.000000   0.030000 (  0.022134)
I would use binary heap for most the cases since it is far more efficient than binary search tree

I would use Binary search tree when there is elements less than 1000 in the database.
