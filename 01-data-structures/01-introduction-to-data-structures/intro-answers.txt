1. For Line class, if line array is initialized and already filled with string of people,
it will be accessed with its functions inside of Line class such as join, leave,
front, middle, back, search.
For Screen class, it will be filled up with data when it first initializes in
initialize parameters, and data in screen class will be accessed or modified using
insert(pixel, x, y) and at(x, y) method

2. For line class, element inside of this Data Structure can be found with front,
middle, back and search method since those closely deal with accessing datas.
For Screen class, at(x, y) function will search for the pixel at particular coordinates
that were accessed from its parameters.

3. I believe Line class looks very similar to Queue Data Structure, which pops item
that were inserted last, and Screen class can be used in games that has x, y coordinates.
